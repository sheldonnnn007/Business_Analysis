**<u>What is "Customer Analytics"?</u>**

Customer analytics refers to the collection, management, analysis and strategic leverage of an organization's granular data about the behaviour(s) of its customers.

Customer analytics can be characterised as:

<u>Inherently granular</u>: a focus on individual-level behavior, not aggregate patterns

<u>Behavioural</u>: primary focus is on observed behavioural pattern(s), not demographics or attitudes.

<u>Forward-looking</u>: an orientation towards prediction, not just description

<u>Multi-platform</u>: desire to combine behaviors from multiple measurement systems

<u>Broadly applicable</u>: the definition of a "customer" is industry agnostic - it could be a user, reader, visiter, donor, client, etc

<u>Multidisciplinary</u>: relevant fields include marketing, statistics, computer science, information science, and operations research.
